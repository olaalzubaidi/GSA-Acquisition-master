<b> <center>PLANNING A PERFORMANCE-BASED WORK STATEMENT FOR</center>

<center>SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT CONTRACTS</b></font>

<!-- Font changed to Courier with size 12 --></center>



<p>

Performance Based Service Contracting focuses on three critical

elements, a performance work statement, a quality assurance plan

and appropriate incentives.  Additional information on the

concepts being implemented for contracted services can be found in

the OFPP Guide to Best Practices for Performance-based Service

Contracting.  This document discusses these elements as they

relate to the performance-based work statement for contracts. <br>

<p>

The performance work statement defines the Government's 

requirements in terms of the objective and measurable outputs.  It

should provide the vendor with answers to five basic questions:

what, when, where, how many, and how well.  It is important to

accurately answer these questions in order to allow the vendor the

opportunity to accurately assess resources required and risks

involved. <br>

<p>

It is recommended that a team of specialists be assigned to

facilitate developing more comprehensive statements of work that

efficiently structure and clearly define the requirements,

performance standards, acceptable quality levels, methods of

surveillance, incentives (positive and negative), and evaluation

criteria.  The team should consist of contract specialists,

computer technical specialists, and subject matter specialists

representing customers within the scope of the project.<br>

<p>

This document describes items that can be included in performance 

work statements for acquiring computer application systems or

software development services through a contracting effort.  These

items are discussed as follows:<br>

<p>

<p>

<b> 1.0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;INTRODUCTION, OVERVIEW, OR BACKGROUND</b><br>

<p>

This section provides background and descriptions of the Agency's 

organizational structure, where the services are to be provided,

the importance of the software development effort, any previous

efforts germane to this effort, and the hardware and software

resources in use.  This section could also include agency or

organization specific information about government furnished

items, working hours, federal holidays, and a glossary to define

terms used within the body of the work statement.  <br>

<P>

<b> 2.0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OBJECTIVE</b><br>

<p>

This section includes a brief description of the purpose of the

contract.<br>

<p>

<b>3.0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SCOPE<br>

</b><br>

This section defines how the contracting effort fits within the

existing or intended customer environment both technically and

organizationally.  Examples of items to include here are a

detailed description of the software development requirement(s),

the number and location of users, the target processing

environment including operating systems, system and data

architecture(s), communications topology, and any other pertinent 

information.<br>

<p>

<b>4.0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS</b><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

Performance requirements are statements describing the required

services in terms of output.  They should express the outputs in

clear, concise, commonly used, easily understood, measurable

terms.  They should <i>not</i> include detailed procedures that dictate

how the work is to be accomplished.  The following statements are 

examples of the kinds of information to be included in the

performance requirements section:<br>

<p>

<B>For New and/or Conversion Software Development -</B><br>

<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!-- Margin release, move back 4 characters -->

*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the life of the contract verify conformance with

agency specific information processing standards and

functional requirements.  Prior to delivery of new

software, demonstrate the operational capability of the

system software. <br>

<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!-- Margin release, move back 4 characters -->

*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interfaces must contain compatibility among system

components in the operational environment. <br>

<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!-- Margin release, move back 4 characters -->

*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Documentation for deliverables must match the agency

specific system processing and operational procedures. <br>

<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!-- Margin release, move back 4 characters -->

*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meet the following delivery dates/milestones; phasing

is an optional approach.  Dates are specified according

to agency delivery requirements. <br>

<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!-- Margin release, move back 4 characters -->

*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Training may vary according to user levels/needs (e.g. 

end users, administrators, analysts, help desk support,

management, etc.). <br>



<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!-- Margin release, move back 4 characters -->

*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Security - meet all Government and agency specific

requirements. <br>

<p>

<B>For New Software Development -</B><br>

<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!-- Margin release, move back 4 characters -->

*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For new software development, delivery of fully

operational systems conforming to the operational

environment and specified user requirements. <br>

<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!-- Margin release, move back 4 characters -->

*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Newly developed software shall not adversely affect

system performance. <br>

<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!-- Margin release, move back 4 characters -->

*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New releases of software must maintain previously

provided functionally, while providing enhanced

capabilities or systems corrections. <br>

<p>

<B>For Conversion Software Development -</B><br>

<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!-- Margin release, move back 4 characters -->

*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For software conversion projects, provide an inventory 

of programs and a description of the complexity of the 

existing systems and programs for transfer to another

processing system or hardware and software platform

operational environment including but not limited to

databases, files, programs, lines of code, and

interdependencies. <br>

<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!-- Margin release, move back 4 characters -->

*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For software conversion efforts involving rehosting to 

another platform, architecture, operating system, data 

base, programming language, and/or communications

system provide an inventory of system and application

programs, descriptions of the current hardware and

software environment, and if applicable data

distribution methods. <br>

<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!-- Margin release, move back 4 characters -->

*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For conversion projects of mission critical systems,

provide parallel processing and/or system validation<!-- Xref Target QuickMark --> of

the old and new systems prior to implementation. <br>

<p>

For each requirement, there should be a corresponding standard(s),

a statement of the maximum allowable degree of deviation from the

standard, the method of surveillance to determine whether the

standard is met, and a positive and/or negative incentive based on

adherence to the standard.<br>

<p>

<b> 5.0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PERFORMANCE STANDARDS</b><br>

<p>

The performance standards establish the performance level(s)

required by the Government.  These standards are driven by the

application system(s) being converted or developed.  The agency

should ensure that each standard is necessary, is carefully

chosen, and not unduly burdensome.  (See Performance Requirements 

Summary for a listing of examples of standards.)<br>

<p>

<b>6.0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;QUALITY ASSURANCE PLAN</b><br>

<p>

The quality assurance plan gives the Government flexibility in

measuring performance and serves as a tool to assure consistent

and uniform assessment of the contractor's performance.<i><b>   </i></b>This plan

is primarily focused on what the Government must do to ensure that

the contractor has performed in accordance with the performance

standards.  It defines how the performance standards will be

applied, the frequency of surveillance, the maximum acceptable

defect rate(s), and the value of each performance requirement as a

percentage of the overall contract.  A good quality assurance plan

should include a surveillance schedule and clearly state the

surveillance methods to be used in monitoring the contractor's

performance.<br>

<p>

The acceptable quality level as defined in the quality assurance

plan establishes a maximum allowable error rate or variation from 

the performance standard(s). Depending on agency level policy and 

procedures the quality assurance plan may or may not be included

as part of the performance work statement in the contract;

however, the methodology for evaluating performance of the

contract must be included.<br>

<p>

<b>7.0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;INCENTIVES - Positive and Negative</b><br>

<p>

Incentives should be used when they will encourage better quality 

performance and may be either positive, negative, or a combination

of both; however, they do not need to be present in every

performance based contract as an additional fee structure.  In a

fixed price contract, the incentives would be embodied in the

pricing and the contractor could either maximize profit through

effective performance or have payments reduced because of failure

to meet the performance standard.<br>

<!-- Margin release, move back 4 characters -->

<B>Positive Incentives -</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actions to take if the work exceeds the 

standards.  Standards should be

challenging, yet reasonably attainable. <br>

<!-- Margin release, move back 4 characters -->

<!-- Margin release, move back 4 characters -->

<B>Negative Incentives -</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actions to take if work does not meet

standards. <br>

<p>

The definitions of standard performance, maximum positive and

negative performance incentives, and the units of measurement

should be established in the solicitation.  They will vary from

contract to contract and are subject to discussion during a source

selection.  It is necessary to balance value to the Government and

meaningful incentives to the contractor.  Incentives should

correlate with results.  Follow-up is necessary to ensure that

desired results are realized, i.e., ensure that incentives

actually encourage good performance and discourage unsatisfactory

performance.<br>

<p>

<b>8.0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EVALUATION CRITERIA</b><br>

<p>

The evaluation criteria is defined under Section M<i><b>  </i></b>in the

solicitation document. This section describes how proposals will

be evaluated in terms of technical merit and costs.  The criteria 

are developed based on the requirements of the specific project.  

Critical areas discussed in the performance-based work statement

and the relative order of importance assigned to each of these

areas must be identified.  The elements are usually presented as a

matrix to be used in evaluating the technical proposals.  Past

Performance must be included as a criterion.  Section L of this

same document contains instructions for the preparation of the

prospective offerors' technical and business proposals.<br>

<P>

<b>9.0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS SUMMARY</b><br>

<p>

The performance requirements summary can be presented as a matrix 

similar to the examples starting on the next page.  This type of

chart could be included in the performance work statement or

placed elsewhere in the contract to summarize the requirements and

display the relationships of each of the elements in the

performance work statement. The summary chart is a tool that can

easily summarize the elements presented in the performance work

statement.  Notice, for each requirement there can be one or more 

standards, defined maximum allowable degree of deviation from the 

standard(s),  method(s) of surveillance to determine adherence to 

the standard(s), and positive and negative incentives for meeting,

exceeding, or failing to meet the standard(s).<p>
