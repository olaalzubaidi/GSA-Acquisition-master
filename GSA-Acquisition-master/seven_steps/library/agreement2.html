  <DD>
<P>
The National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) seeks to acquire an upgrade
to the capabilities of its current high-end operational computer system in 1998.  The
desired new system (the Class VIII system) will replace the current NCEP supercomputer
and will function as the centerpiece of the computing and communications system used for
predictive environmental modeling within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA).  The Class VIII system will be used at NCEP to assimilate the
data which are the foundation for operational environmental modeling and to execute the
numerical models which form the basis for all routine environmental forecasts, public and
private, produced in the United States.
<P>
The need to upgrade the NCEP supercomputer is identified in the current NOAA
Strategic Plan and is essential to achieve NOAA's strategic goal to "Advance Short-Term
Warnings and Forecast Services".  This upgrade is also critical to the attainment of the
NOAA strategic goal to "Implement Seasonal to Interannual Climate Forecasts".  Many
specific environmental modeling and forecast goals for the years 1999 through 2003, as
identified in the current NOAA Operational IT Plan, are dependent upon the timely
acquisition of the Class VIII system.
<P>
Within the National Weather Service (NWS) the NCEP Class VIII system is one of the
technology components of the Modernization and Associated Restructuring program. 
This program was designed to apply modern technology to environmental forecasting
problems and to streamline the NWS forecast process and is described in the <EM>Strategic
Plan for the Modernization and Associated Restructuring of the National Weather
Service</EM>.
<P>
The role of the Class VIII system is more fully described in a number of NCEP
documents.  One of these is the current NCEP Information Technology Plan,
Requirements Analysis number NA-W-WD-95-01, which describes organization-wide
plans for computing at NCEP.
<P>
In order to fulfill the objective of acquiring a Class VIII system in 1998, NCEP will utilize
the Department of Commerce's re-engineered acquisition process termed CONOPS.  That
process is described in a document entitled <EM>Department of Commerce Acquisition Process
Case for Change</EM>.  The intent of the new process is to create an improved acquisition
environment which will benefit both the vendor community and the Government.  In order
to successfully implement this new process the Government seeks the cooperation of the
vendor community in an effort to conduct business in an atmosphere of integrity,
openness, and fairness.
<P>
This Project Agreement establishes an agreement between the Class VIII Acquisition
Team (the project team) and the senior management of the National Weather Service. 
The agreement empowers the project team to research, acquire, deploy, and monitor the
systems and services that comprise the Class VIII system.  The Project Agreement
outlines the objectives of the project, project team duties, budget availability, and the 
high-level milestones for the accomplishment of these project objectives.

<A NAME=Authority>
  <DT><STRONG><FONT SIZE="+1">II.       Authority</FONT></STRONG>
  <DD>
<P>
This project is hereby authorized by the Acting Assistant Administrator for Weather
Services and the Director of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction.  It is
identified as a requirement of NCEP, the organization tasked with operating state-of-the-art 
computer systems to execute prediction models in support of the Nation's
environmental forecasting program.
<P>
The Class VIII acquisition undertaken by this project will require a Delegation of
Procurement Authority from the Department of Commerce, Office of Budget,
Management and Information.
<BR><BR>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME=ProjObj>
  <DT><STRONG><FONT SIZE="+1">III.      Project Objective</FONT></STRONG>
  <DD>
<P>
The project team will secure a Class VIII computing system for the National Centers for
Environmental Prediction.  This system must be operational prior to March, 1999 when
the support contract for the current system ends.  The new system will be installed in
Building 28 at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.
<P>
NCEP has in the past replaced its high-end systems on a five-year cycle.  One of the
objectives of this project is to more effectively maintain currency in the rapidly evolving
technology which comprises such systems.  As demonstrated in the NCEP Class VIII
High-Performance Computer Acquisition Cost/Benefit Analysis, it is possible to increase
the overall computing capacity of NCEP supercomputer systems and to do so with
improved cost effectiveness by reducing the replacement cycle for these systems to three
years.  Accordingly, it is anticipated that a system intended to replace the system acquired
through this project will be procured three years after the Class VIII is accepted.
<P>
Another method by which the project team will help to ensure that the Class VIII system
efficiently delivers as much computational capacity as possible is to evaluate its
performance annually.  The annual review process will include a consideration of how to
best achieve graduated performance goals via mid-life system enhancements intended to
foster continued cost effective operations.
<P>
The field of Numerical Weather Prediction is scientifically exciting today as the accuracy
of environmental forecast models approaches levels undreamed of ten years ago.  Higher
resolution models with improved physics will enable the NWS to produce forecasts with
better spatial resolution and valid at longer time scales than ever before.  These expanded
models are computationally demanding and require very robust capabilities in order to
execute within a fixed time window of short duration.  Therefore, the primary project
objective is to secure the maximum level of performance possible within the constraints of
the budget.  The minimum acceptable performance is a system that is at least five times
faster than the current NCEP high-end system.
<P>
The NCEP Class VIII system is more than simply a high-speed computer.  It includes
additional hardware (storage devices, communications interfaces, and other peripherals),
software (primarily, but not limited to, the operating system and compilers), full system
maintenance, and support services.  This system comprises the core computational
resource for the Numerical Weather Prediction efforts of the National Weather Service. 
This operational system provides essential governmental services and, therefore, a second
key objective of the project team is to obtain a system with a very high level of reliability
and availability.

<A NAME=Approach>
  <DT><STRONG><FONT SIZE="+1">IV.       Approach</FONT></STRONG>
  <DD>
<P>
This project will follow the general approach and guidelines established during the
CONOPS pilot studies conducted in 1996 and 1997.  This will speed the exchange of
information, help assure equal opportunity for all respondents and encourage openness by
making as much information as possible available simultaneously to all parties.  It is
intended to meet the Government's need for computing capabilities by contracting with
the private sector.  This process makes use of market research to help determine an
acquisition strategy and to refine the Government's requirements in relation to the
capabilities and approaches of the private sector.
<P>
To promote an equitable and active dialog with all members of private industry who may
be interested in responding to the stated needs of the Government, electronic communications will be used extensively throughout this solicitation process.  This will speed
the exchange of information and help assure equal opportunity for all respondents, and is
intended to encourage openness by making as much information as possible available
simultaneously to all parties.  This Project Agreement and the solicitation documents that
result from the work of the project team will be posted publicly on the Internet.

<P>
The Class VIII Acquisition Team consists of a core group which provides the steering and
decision-making authority for the project.  This group is augmented by associates and
consultants from several parts of the Department of Commerce.  The team is headed by a
project team leader who has overall authority and responsibility for the successful
accomplishment of the project objective and fulfillment of the terms of this Project
Agreement.  The selection and assignment of other team members has been made on the
basis of cross-functional needs and includes a warranted procurement official, a
procurement specialist, program representatives, an information technology analyst, a
budget analyst, a legal representative, and project advisors.

<P>
The project team is hereby authorized to take all steps necessary for the acquisition of the
NCEP Class VIII computer system, including related hardware, software, and support
services.  Subject to the Delegation of Procurement Authority as noted in Section II, the
project team has complete acquisition authority and source selection authority.  No
authorizations other than those already obtained or described in this agreement will be
required.  This is critical in order to maintain the aggressive schedule necessary for this
acquisition.
<P>
The project team is empowered to conduct any acquisitions necessary to support the Class
VIII procurement.  This includes complete authority to conduct micro purchases, purchase
card acquisitions, and contracting by other methods, within the budgetary limits and within
the project scope described in the Project Agreement.  All contracts will be executed by a
warranted Contracting Officer who is a member of the project team.
<P>
The project team will fulfill its responsibilities with respect to management oversight by
conducting briefings immediately prior to the following actions:
<P>
    <DL><DL>
      <DD>1. release of solicitation and statement of need,<P>
      <DD>2. award decision,<P>
      <DD>3. system acceptance,<P>
      <DD>4. system fully operational.<P>
    </DL></DL>

<P>
In addition to the project team conducting briefings for management prior to the actions
noted above, briefings on the status of the acquisition process will be provided by the
project team leader more frequently, e.g. approximately monthly.  The briefings will
include a review of project milestones, an update of the state of the budget supporting the
Class VIII system, and an assessment of the status of the goals and objectives of the
project.  The briefings will also provide a forum to raise and address other issues which
the project team feels might be of interest to those providing management oversight. 
Finally, the briefings will afford managers the opportunity to raise questions or topics
which they believe the project team should address.
<P>
It is the intent of the parties to this Project Agreement that except under unusual
circumstances no additional reviews or documentation will be required.  The project team
includes oversight advisors who will participate throughout the acquisition process and
that on-going interaction will serve in lieu of reviews and clearances by the Office of
Acquisition Management, the Office of Budget and Management Information, NOAA, and
the NWS.

The total value of the Class VIII Acquisition project is estimated to be $35,800,000.  This
represents a planning level approved by NOAA and the Department of Commerce, but not
yet approved by the Office of Management and Budget.  Funding is planned over a four-year period covering fiscal years 1999 through 2002 and will be provided through the
appropriation process annually, subject to the availability of funds.  This level of funding is
intended to acquire an appropriate computer system, including all system maintenance,
support, and mid-life system enhancements, with acquisition costs spread evenly over a
three-year period (fiscal years 1999 through 2001); and to operate that system over a
four-year life cycle (fiscal years 1999 through 2002).  The following is the annual
breakdown of the funding planned for this acquisition.

The overarching goal of this project is to take all steps necessary to provide for the timely
acquisition and continued availability of the NCEP Class VIII system, including related
hardware, software, and support services.  To ensure that the capabilities of this system
will be available when needed, the project team plans to award the Class VIII contract in
March, 1998.  This contract will call for the subsequent installation of a system in July,
1998.  Acceptance of that system is scheduled to occur in October, 1998, after which time
the operational use of the system will begin.

  <DD>
<P>
The project begins at the date of the approval of this document and concludes when the
Class VIII system is removed from operations.  The system life is projected to be four
years.  The final year of operation for this system will overlap with the first year of
operation for a successor system.

<A NAME=PerfGoals>
  <DT><FONT SIZE="+1"><STRONG>X.        Performance Goals and Measures</STRONG></FONT>
  <DD>
<P>
This project activity has clearly defined performance requirements as well as fiscal and
temporal constraints.  The project team intends to acquire the best supercomputer system
available for the budgeted level of funding and to do so in a way that accommodates the
termination of the use of the current supercomputer in February, 1999.  Maintaining the
acquisition schedule described herein, which is designed to support the withdrawal of the
current system from operations at the completion of the existing contract, while at the
same time providing adequate computational resources is the highest priority for the
project team.
<P>
In order to meet NCEP's performance requirements, the computational capacity of
proposed Class VIII systems will be measured by carefully reviewing demonstrated
performance on a suite of NCEP benchmark programs.  Once the Class VIII system is
installed and operational, the project team will ensure the continuing acceptability of the
Class VIII system and verify that its utilization supports all pertinent operational schedules
and appropriate scientific goals.
<P>
Performance monitoring during the life of the system will be continuous.  System
availability of not less than 96 per cent has been the historical goal for high-end systems at
NCEP and this system will meet or exceed that requirement.
<P>
During the life of the Class VIII system, the project team will conduct annual reviews of
the system in order to consider its performance and to evaluate opportunities for
extending its capabilities.  System upgrades must be available within the initial budget
constraints of this acquisition and the review process which will result in decisions on how
best to enhance overall performance will begin within one year of system acceptance.
<P>
The Class VIII system must offer sufficient capacity to support the necessary activities of
the Environmental Modeling Center and other legitimate user groups in addition to the
execution of operational numerical models and other mission-critical applications.
<P>
The following table, submitted as a portion of the 1997 NOAA Operational  IT Plan,
summarizes some pertinent operational performance measures.  Those for fiscal years
1999 and beyond are explicitly dependent upon the timely acquisition of the Class VIII
system and so are most appropriate for this Project Agreement.

<P>
The shaded entries here are those directly dependent upon the availability of the
computational capacity and performance of the Class VIII system.
<P>
The statistics used to measure performance in the table above require some explanation. 
In the case of the hurricane prediction system, 24-hour position accuracy refers to the
difference between the actual and 24-hour forecast positions of the centers of hurricanes
or other tropical storms as measured in kilometers.  The table shows that the amount of
error for such forecasts should be less than 130 kilometers in the year 2000.
<P>
Quantitative precipitation forecasting is one of the most demanding forecast problems
routinely addressed by the NWS.  The accuracy of such forecasts is measured using skill
scores for the occurrence of precipitation which exceeds a particular threshold value.  In
the case of both the mesoscale prediction system and the short-range ensemble forecasting
system, the table reflects a measure of forecast skill against a threshold value of one inch. 
The skill score is a statistic derived by comparing forecast and observed areas for the
event of interest, here the occurrence of greater than one inch of precipitation.  A perfect
forecast would yield a skill score of 1.00, whereas a forecast that is completely erroneous
would result in a skill score of 0.00.  The figures in the table for the mesoscale prediction
system and the short-range ensemble forecasting system indicate an expectation of an
increase in forecast skill of about 25 per cent between 1997 and 2000.
<P>
The indicated performance measure for the global prediction system is the mean difference
between the actual and 24-hour forecast of wind velocity at approximately 34,000 feet
above the surface of the earth as measured in meters per second.  The table shows that the
average world-wide error of such forecasts should be not higher than 6.0 meters per
second in 1999.
<P>
The final measure in the table relates the performance of the coupled model to the
occurrence of El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events.  This is a subtle forecast
problem and the measure of the degree to which these events can be successfully predicted
is accordingly complex.  ENSO events are typically measured by the magnitude of the
departure from climatological norms for sea surface temperatures within a given index
area in the equatorial Pacific ocean.  The official index area that NCEP uses to define El
Nino occurrences and within which it measures forecast skill is the region from 120 to 170
degrees west longitude and between 5 degrees north and 5 degrees south latitude.  This
region is known as Nino3.4.  The indicated performance measure for the coupled ENSO
model is the correlation of the Nino3.4 sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTa)
comparing current observations with forecasts made 6-month prior to those occurrences,
as averaged over a 5-year period.  The table indicates the skill for El Nino forecasts with a
6-month lead time for the period from 1997 to 2001 should reach 0.75.  That amounts to
approximately a 15 per cent increase in the level of skill of the coupled model according to
this statistical measure.
