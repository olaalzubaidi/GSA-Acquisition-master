 <B>INTRODUCTION</CENTER><BR>

</B>

<P>

The National Performance Review (NPR) and the Office of Management

and Budget's Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) coordinated

an interagency working group to develop performance-based concepts

for government agencies to use in the procurement of call center

services.  This effort combines the initiatives of improved customer

service across government with the streamlining and reform of

procurement. The performance-based concepts are presented in Section

4.<BR>

<P>

The American people have become accustomed to toll-free 800 numbers

as an efficient way to request and receive services in all aspects

of their lives.  Responding to telephone calls is a top priority

in customer service all across the government.  More Americans

contact the government by phone than any other way.  Toll-free,

or &quot;800&quot; telephone numbers are contracted through the

Federal Telecommunications Service and are used by many agencies

who maintain call centers.  These call centers are either managed

in-house or contracted out and provide a variety of services.

 They include:<BR>

<P>

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Safe Drinking Water

Hotline provides access to information specialists who can help

the regulated community, State and local officials and the public

to understand the regulations and programs developed in response

to the Safe Drinking Water Act.  Approximately 3,000 to 5,000

calls per month are handled by this hotline.  This hotline has

been contracted out since 1988.  <BR>

<P>

The General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Information

Center is a toll-free answer line for callers with inquiries about

federal agencies, programs, and services.  It responds to 175,000

calls a month.  The service has been contracted out since 1990.

<P>

The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) hotline provides

callers with up-to-date safety and recall information and has

the capability for the public to report problems with products.

 Approximately 15,000 calls per month are handled by this hotline.

 It has been contracted out since 1989.<BR>

<P>

The NPR Report:<U> Putting Customers First-Serving the American

Public: Best Practices in Telephone Services, </U>dated February

1995, discusses the importance of telephone access and the reasons

why call center services are  a good target for improvement. 

Telephone services can be a very cost-effective method of serving

people, especially in a time of declining budgets.  <BR>

<P>

Call center services are suitable for Performance-Based Service

Contracting (PBSC):  <BR>

<P>

<UL>

<LI></FONT> PBSC, with its emphasis on standards

for customer service, incentives, and measurement of performance,

offers an excellent opportunity to save money while obtaining

improved  performance in areas where the government directly interacts

with the public.   <BR>

<P>

<LI></FONT> While the customer base served

and the information and specific services  provided are different

for each call center, the function of providing access and serving

customers is not.  There are hundreds and thousands of call centers

both in industry and government and standards of excellence and

best practices exist.<BR>

<P>

<LI></FONT> The service to be provided is

relatively manageable and predictable.  Anticipated call center

activity can be objectively defined and measured in terms of the

number of calls expected, the type of service provided, and the

acceptability of answers which can be provided.  For call centers,

historical data can be used to forecast routine call loads and

to anticipate periodic surges in activity.  The kinds and level

of service that the call center will provide can be specified,

i.e. providing consumer information, technical assistance, case

management, making referrals, taking complaints, ordering documents,

etc.  The questions which can be answered by a call center will

depend on specific customer needs and the mission of the program

providing the information.  Acceptable answers can be defined

in terms of limited subject areas and level of service to be provided.

<BR>

<P>

<LI></FONT> The &quot;end product&quot; is

relatively straightforward.  Callers need access to information

and services which are available from the agency.  Agencies need

a reliable service which allows them to interact with their customers,

provides a low maintenance way to measure and predict the quality

of that interaction, and provides them with enough feedback to

adjust to changing customer needs.<BR>

<P>

<LI></FONT> PBSC focuses on results rather

than process.  <BR>

<P>

<B><CENTER> OBJECTIVES</CENTER><BR>

</B>

<P>

The working group's objectives were to develop a document for

program and acquisition officials to assist them in drafting:

<BR>

<P>

<UL>

<LI></FONT> performance requirements (what

needs to be done),<BR>

<P>

<LI></FONT> performance standards (how well

it needs to be done),<BR>

<P>

<LI></FONT> measurement techniques (how performance

will be assessed versus standards),<BR>

<P>

<LI></FONT> positive and negative incentives

(tied to quality assurance measurements) and<BR>

<P>

<LI></FONT> evaluation criteria (technical

selection factors).<BR>

</UL>

<BR>

<P>

This document is not intended to be a statement of work, but a

generic description of PBSC concepts as they might apply to a

call center operation; neither is it intended to communicate the

level of detail that would be needed to place a contract. <BR>

<P>

Agencies are encouraged to contract for call center services using

 PBSC, and to use   these generic requirements, standards, incentives,

QA plans, and evaluation criteria to develop program requirements

and contract language.  A working group consisting of technical

and procurement personnel from the Departments of Energy and Health

and Human Services, CPSC, EPA, GSA, NPR, and OFPP have developed

this document for use as a reference source for agency voluntary

use.            <BR>

<CENTER> <B>SECTION 2<BR></B>

<P>

<B>PERFORMANCE-BASED<br>

SERVICE CONTRACTING (PBSC)</CENTER><BR></B>

<P>

PBSC structures an acquisition around the purpose of the work

to be performed as opposed to the manner in which the work is

to be performed or through broad or imprecise statements of work.

 It is designed to ensure that contractors are given freedom to

determine how to meet the government's performance objectives,

that appropriate performance quality levels are achieved, and

that payment is made only for services that meet these levels.

 It emphasizes objective, measurable performance requirements

and quality standards in developing statements of work.  <BR>

<P>

Examples of performance-based requirements can vary.  PBSC can

be used for fairly simple, low tech requirements such as grounds

maintenance.  Performance requirements for  grounds maintenance

of a large government site could be to maintain the lawn between

two and three inches, prevent tree limbs from touching utility

wires or buildings, and maintain lawns and sidewalks free from

branches and clippings, rather than &quot;how to&quot; requirements

such as mow lawn weekly, prune trees each fall and remove clippings

after each mowing.  In an example of applying PBSC to a highly

complex set of requirements, a performance requirement for software

development could be to develop documentation for deliverables

that meets agency standards of accuracy and completeness.<BR>

<P>

The use of PBSC methods has been demonstrated to result in significant

cost savings.  There is a major governmentwide PBSC pilot program

in effect at the present time.  Twenty-three agencies are participating

in this effort; cost savings of fifteen percent have been realized

so far with improved contractor performance.  <BR>

<P>

Use of PBSC methods should have the net effect of shifting some

of the manageable performance risk from the government to the

contractor.  Contractors will be given more latitude for determining

methods of performance with more responsibility for performance

quality.   

<P>

PBSC is consistent with the principles of streamlining and innovation

of the NPR as well as the Government Performance and Results Act.

Practices for Performance-Based Service</I> <I>Contracting</I>

<P>

ELEMENTS OF PBSC <BR></B></CENTER>

<P>

There are five essential elements of PBSC: <BR>

<P>

<B>Performance Requirements<BR>

</B>

<P>

   One of the first steps in developing a performance work statement

(PWS) is identifying the agency's needs and addressing those needs

with performance requirements.  Performance requirements will

be unique to each agency and the customers it serves. These requirements

are statements describing the required services in terms of output.

 The requirements should be stated in clear, concise, commonly

used, easily understood, measurable terms.  Detailed procedures

should not be included that dictate how the work is to be accomplished;

rather, the requirements should allow the contractor the latitude

to work in a manner best suited for innovation and creativity.

<P>

<B>Performance Standards<BR></B>

<P>

Performance standards establish the performance level required

by the government.  Each agency should ensure that each standard

is necessary, is carefully described, and not unduly burdensome.

 Failure to do so can result in unnecessarily increased contract

costs.  Discretion must also be exercised in establishing the

quality level at which performance standards are set.  The minimum

acceptable performance standard should rarely be 100 percent,

since the standard directly affects the cost of the service. 

 If the quality level is too low, it may act as a disincentive

to good contract performance.  Standards should pass a common

sense test (i.e. if they are too rigid, neither the government

nor the contractor will have the flexibility to accommodate infrequent

but uncontrollable events or changing circumstances).  Standards

may be published or well recognized industrywide standards, or

may be developed by the agency based on past workload, best practices

or customer needs.  Agency standards should have industry input

to ensure that they are realistic and effective.     <BR>

<P>

<B>Measurement Techniques<BR></B>

<P>

Measurement techniques should be clearly stated in the quality

assurance plan (QAP).  The QAP defines what the government must

do to ensure that the contractor has performed in accordance with

the PWS performance standards.  It is needed to ensure the government

receives the quality of services called for under the contract,

and pays only for the acceptable level of services received. 

A good QAP should include a surveillance schedule and clearly

state the surveillance method(s) to be used.  Section 4 suggests

the methods that can be used in monitoring the contractor's performance.

 In selecting the appropriate method, take into consideration

task criticality, surveillance period, performance requirements

and standards, and available resources.<BR>

<P>

<B>Incentives - Positive and Negative<BR></B>

<P>

Incentives should be used when they will encourage better quality

performance and may be either positive, negative, or a combination

of both.  Positive incentives are actions to take if the work

exceeds the standards.   Negative incentives are actions to take

if work does not meet standards.  Incentives should be challenging

yet reasonably attainable. Incentives should be applied selectively

to motivate contractor efforts that might not otherwise be emphasized,

and to encourage efficiency.  The definitions of standard performance,

maximum positive and negative performance incentives, and the

units of measurement  should be established in the solicitation.

 They will vary from contract to contract and are subject to discussion

during a source selection.  Incentives should correlate with results.

 Follow-up is necessary to ensure that desired results are realized,

i.e., ensure that incentives actually encourage good performance

and discourage unsatisfactory performance.  Where negative incentives

are used, the deduction should represent as closely as possible

the value of the service lost.  Avoid rewarding contractors for

simply meeting minimum standards of contract performance, and

create a balance between cost, performance, and schedule incentives.<BR>

<P>

Incentives are not strictly monetary; the use of past performance

is a powerful incentive.  Past performance &quot;report cards&quot;

should reflect adherence to performance requirements when a performance-based

work statement has been used.  Performance under PBSC provides

better data for evaluation of past performance for other solicitations.

 A strong incentive of excellence and customer satisfaction is

created when contractors know their performance will influence

future award decisions.<BR>

<P>

<B>Evaluation Criteria<BR></B>

<P>

Evaluation criteria that are used to assess offeror's proposals

and select the contractor should typically strive to select the

offeror that will most likely provide the best value  (combination

of price and performance) to the agency.  Evaluation criteria

should be kept to a minimum to help ensure that selection decisions

are based on significant determinants, and each of the criteria

used should receive a significant weighting.  However, the relative

emphasis given to each of the criteria must be determined by the

agency.<BR>

Evaluation Criteria<BR></B></CENTER>

<P>

Key to the successful use of any factor in the source selection

process is the establishment of a clear relationship between the

performance work statement (PWS), Section L (instructions to offerors)

and Section M (evaluation criteria).  The factors chosen for evaluation

should track back to the requirements in the PWS.  They should

be reasonable, logical, and coherent.<BR>

<P>

The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.605(b)(1) establishes

past performance as one of two mandatory evaluation factors, along

with price or cost, for all competitively negotiated acquisitions

expected to exceed $100,000, unless the contracting officer documents

in the contract file the reasons why past performance should not

be evaluated.  The use of past performance as an evaluation factor

in the contract award process enables agencies to better predict

the quality of, and customer satisfaction with, future work. 

It also provides contractors with a powerful incentive to strive

for excellence.<BR>

<P>

Past performance factors should be tailored to the key performance

criteria in the PWS.  When the PWS is performance-based, the past

performance factors and questions to ask references can specifically

address the contractors' capability of meeting the performance

standards.  For example, the ability of a contractor to forecast

and schedule call center staffing and activity is very important

to successful management of a center.  Therefore, if one of the

performance standards on a call center contract is that the contractor

must respond within 2 minutes when answering specific questions,

the past performance evaluation can objectively address how well

the contractor met equivalent standards on past contracts.<BR>

<P>

Offeror's proposed technical performance - Under PBSC, offerors

may use quite different approaches to address how performance

standards will be met and how the level of quality will be achieved.

 Offerors' proposals may be written, oral or a combination thereof.

<BR>

<P>

Cost realism is another evaluation factor that should be considered.

 Proposals should be reviewed for cost realism to assess the offeror's

understanding of the requirements, consistency with their technical

proposals, and risk.<BR>
