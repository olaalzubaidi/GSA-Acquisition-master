</h2>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="1046484"> </a>The Circular provides that it is the policy of the Government to (a) rely generally on private commercial sources for supplies and services, if certain criteria are met, while recognizing that some functions are inherently Governmental and must be performed by Government personnel, and (b) give appropriate consideration to relative cost in deciding between Government performance and performance under contract. In comparing the costs of Government and contractor performance, the Circular provides that agencies shall base the contractor's cost of performance on firm offers.
