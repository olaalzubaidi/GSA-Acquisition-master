</h2>
<dl>
  <dt class="Indented1"> <a name="1046560"> </a>(a)  Acquisition planning should begin as soon as the agency need is identified, preferably well in advance of the fiscal year in which contract award is necessary. In developing the plan, the planner shall form a team consisting of all those who will be responsible for significant aspects of the acquisition, such as contracting, fiscal, legal, and technical personnel. The planner should review previous plans for similar acquisitions and discuss them with the key personnel involved in those acquisitions. At key dates specified in the plan or whenever significant changes occur, and no less often than annually, the planner shall review the plan and, if appropriate, revise it.
  <dt class="Indented1"> <a name="1046561"> </a>(b)  Requirements and logistics personnel should avoid issuing requirements on an urgent basis or with unrealistic delivery or performance schedules, since it generally restricts competition and increases prices. Early in the planning process, the planner should consult requirements and logistics personnel who determine type, quality, quantity, and delivery requirements.
  <dt class="Indented1"> <a name="1046562"> </a>(c)  The planner shall coordinate with and secure the concurrence of the contracting officer in all acquisition planning. If the plan proposes using other than full and open competition, the plan shall also be coordinated with the cognizant competition advocate.

</h2>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="1046564"> </a>In order to facilitate attainment of the acquisition objectives, the plan must identify those milestones at which decisions should be made (see subparagraph (b)(18) of this section). The plan must address all the technical, business, management, and other significant considerations that will control the acquisition. The specific content of plans will vary, depending on the nature, circumstances, and stage of the acquisition. In preparing the plan, the planner must follow the applicable instructions in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, together with the agency's implementing procedures.  Acquisition plans for service contracts must describe the strategies for implementing performance-based contracting methods or must provide rationale for not using those methods (see Subpart 37.6).

Proposals submitted in response to such requirements may include the following:

  <a name="1046630"> </a>7.107   Additional requirements for acquisitions involving bundling.
</h2>
<dl>
  <dt class="Indented1"> <a name="1046631"> </a>(a)  Bundling may provide substantial benefits to the Government. However, because of the potential impact on small business participation, the head of the agency must conduct market research to determine whether bundling is necessary and justified (15 U.S.C. 644(e)(2)). Market research may indicate that bundling is necessary and justified if an agency would derive measurably substantial benefits (see 10.001(a)(2)(iv) and (a)(3)(vi)).
  <dt class="Indented1"> <a name="1046632"> </a>(b)  Measurably substantial benefits may include, individually or in any combination or aggregate, cost savings or price reduction, quality improvements that will save time or improve or enhance performance or efficiency, reduction in acquisition cycle times, better terms and conditions, and any other benefits. The agency must quantify the identified benefits and explain how their impact would be measurably substantial. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the agency may determine bundling to be necessary and justified if, as compared to the benefits that it would derive from contracting to meet those requirements if not bundled, it would derive measurably substantial benefits equivalent to-
  <dl>
    <dt class="Indented2"> <a name="1046633"> </a>(1)  Ten percent of the estimated contract value (including options) if the value is $75 million or less; or
    <dt class="Indented2"> <a name="1046634"> </a>(2)  Five percent of the estimated contract value (including options) or $7.5 million, whichever is greater, if the value exceeds $75 million.
  </dl>
  <dt class="Indented1"> <a name="1046635"> </a>(c)  Without power of delegation, the service acquisition executive for the military departments, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics for the defense agencies, or the Deputy Secretary or equivalent for the civilian agencies may determine that bundling is necessary and justified when-
  <dl>
    <dt class="Indented2"> <a name="1046638"> </a>(1)  The expected benefits do not meet the thresholds in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section but are critical to the agency's mission success; and 
    <dt class="Indented2"> <a name="1046639"> </a>(2)  The acquisition strategy provides for maximum practicable participation by small business concerns.
  </dl>
  <dt class="Indented1"> <a name="1046640"> </a>(d)  Reduction of administrative or personnel costs alone is not sufficient justification for bundling unless the cost savings are expected to be at least 10 percent of the estimated contract value (including options) of the bundled requirements.
  <dt class="Indented1"> <a name="1046641"> </a>(e)  Substantial bundling is any bundling that results in a contract with an average annual value of $10 million or more. When the proposed acquisition strategy involves substantial bundling, the acquisition strategy must-
  <dl>
    <dt class="Indented2"> <a name="1046642"> </a>(1)  Identify the specific benefits anticipated to be derived from bundling;
    <dt class="Indented2"> <a name="1046643"> </a>(2)  Include an assessment of the specific impediments to participation by small business concerns as contractors that result from bundling;
    <dt class="Indented2"> <a name="1046644"> </a>(3)  Specify actions designed to maximize small business participation as contractors, including provisions that encourage small business teaming;
    <dt class="Indented2"> <a name="1046645"> </a>(4)  Specify actions designed to maximize small business participation as subcontractors (including suppliers) at any tier under the contract or contracts that may be awarded to meet the requirements; and
    <dt class="Indented2"> <a name="1046646"> </a>(5)  Include a specific determination that the anticipated benefits of the proposed bundled contract justify its use.
  </dl>
  <dt class="Indented1"> <a name="1046647"> </a>(f)  The contracting officer must justify bundling in acquisition strategy documentation.
  <dt class="Indented1"> <a name="1046648"> </a>(g)  In assessing whether cost savings would be achieved through bundling, the contracting officer must consider the cost that has been charged or, where data is available, could be charged by small business concerns for the same or similar work.
  <dt class="Indented1"> <a name="1046649"> </a>(h)  The requirements of this section, except for paragraph (e), do not apply if a cost comparison analysis will be performed in accordance with OMB Circular A-76.
