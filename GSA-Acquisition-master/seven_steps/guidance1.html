<div  class="subhead"><font color="#000099">
    Guidance for Drafting the Project Agreement </font></div>
  
  



 <p class="text9"><font color="#000099"><font size="4"><b>What is the Project Agreement? </b></font></p>

<p class="text9"><font color="#000099">The Project Agreement is an agreement between a project team and bureau
management for the purpose of empowering a team to achieve project objectives. It is a
high level document written by the project team nominees prior to the commencement of
further work by the team. Since the document is intended to serve to empower the team and
establish the authority, responsibility and accountability of the team to accomplish the
project objectives, it is not intended to be detailed or overly prescriptive. </font></p>

<p class="text9"><font color="#000099">It should provide a basis to establish to management that the team is on
the right track and proceeding in the right direction within available mission directions
and authorities. From the team's and management's perspective it provides a general
roadmap and a realistic projection of the time-frames, milestones, budget, resources and
overall approach that are necessary to achievement of the project objectives. It also
provides the basis for team accountability, management expectations and management review
and course correction where necessary. </font></p>

<p class="text9"><font color="#000099">The Project Agreement also includes performance goals and measures that
further define what is meant by project success and will provide a basis for team
accountability and reward. </font></p>

<p class="text9"><font color="#000099">What follows is section by section guidance for drafting the project
agreement. This guidance should be used in conjunction with the project agreement
templates and example provided to help the team nominees draft their project agreement.</font></p>

<hr>

<p class="text9"><font color="#000099"><b>THE PROJECT AGREEMENT</b></font></p>

<p class="text9"><font color="#000099"><b>I. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE</b></font></p>

<p class="text9"><font color="#000099">In this section provide high-level information that will orient the
reader to the overall strategic purposes for which the Project Team was formed. Answer the
questions:How did we get here? What are we trying to achieve? What long-term goals are
served by this project? What are the high level strategic planning and performance goals
and measures that will be further defined and achieved by execution of this project
agreement? Show linkage to agency Strategic Plans, including Strategic Information
Technology plans, and Annual Performance Plans as well as other appropriate planning and
budget documents. Are there background studies or decision documents that will educate the
reader and help the reader understand the context for the project objectives. What
previous initiatives have set the stage for this project? What other work is on-going that
must be taken into account?</font></p>

<p class="text9"><font color="#000099"><b>II. AUTHORITY</b> </font></p>

<p class="text9"><font color="#000099">By what authority is the work being conducted? Again refer to the
strategic, performance , budgeting and other planning documents. If this is an information
technology project refer to the bureau strategic information plan under which it is
included. You may wish to quote a relevant sentence or paragraph from the plans. If
significant committee decisions, internal or external organizations, public hearings or
legislation have provided a basis for approval, or approved the project, refer to them
here. </p>

<p class="text9"><font color="#000099"><b>III. PROJECT OBJECTIVE</b></font></p>

<p class="text9"><font color="#000099">Clearly and directly state the project objective in terms of the
agency strategic objectives and program mission. The objective should be synonymous with
the purpose of the Project Team's existence. The objective should be a high-level
statement, but may include some details which are descriptive of the project and it's
component parts so as to provide a basis for understanding and agreeing upon the project
objective. Avoid describing or indicating the means by which the objective is to be
achieved. The objective may include or refer to a vision statement describing the
characteristics of the desired result. However caution should be exercised to avoid
issuing vision statements that are overly restrictive or specific which might preclude
other approaches that can achieve the same objective.</font></p>



<p class="text9"><font color="#000099"><b>IV. APPROACH</b></font></p>

<p class="text9"><font color="#000099">This section very broadly describes how the Project Team plans to meet its objectives. How will the Project Team approach its task? How will it inform and engage the private sector? What is the approximate sequence of events? How will the attainment of objectives unfold? How will the private sector be made aware of the project? How and by what process will it be decided what acquisitions, if any, will be conducted?
Will other government agencies or other departments of your agency be invited to
participate? If so, how will that be done? Most of the answers to these questions are found in the CONOPS process. It is appropriate for this section to outline the CONOPS steps that are most relevant and significant to obtaining the project objectives. Provide examples where needed to clarify important points in the process.</font></p>



<p class="text9"><font color="#000099"><b>V. MEMBERS</b></font></p>

<p class="text9"><font color="#000099">The Project Team will consist of a core group which provides the
steering and decision-making authority. This may be augmented by associates or consultants
from elsewhere in or outside the agency. Standing committees or groups with relevant
expertise may also be used to advise the Project Team. </b></font></p>

<p class="text9"><font color="#000099">Members of the Project Team include a project manager/team leader,
who has overall authority and responsibility for the successful accomplishment of the
project objective and fulfillment of the terms of the Project Agreement. The selection and
assignment of other team members will be made on the basis of the Project's
cross-functional need. Teams normally consist of a warranted procurement official, program
representative(s), users, information technology analysts, legal advisors, budget advisors
and others. </font></p>

<p class="text9"><font color="#000099">The team membership serves the purpose of providing relevant
expertise, authority and interest for the accomplishment of the team's objectives. It is
not necessary that all of the expertise, resources and interests be represented in the
form of team membership, however all important relevant interests should be represented on
the team. Attach a list of team members and advisors (optional--and their roles and
responsibilities). (At the discretion of the team, the membership list may not be
publically published. </font></p>



<p class="text9"><font color="#000099"><b>VI. EMPOWERMENT AND MANAGEMENT REVIEW</b></font></p>

<p class="text9"><font color="#000099">This section describes the empowerment sought by the team. It should
state who is providing the empowerment and what objective the team is empowered to
achieve. It should also state the specific forms of empowerment, such as authority to make
critical decisions, to select vendors or other options, to enter into contracts and small
purchases, or authority to enter into agreements with other agencies or components of your
agency. If there are restrictions on team empowerment these should also be stated.</font></p>

<p class="text9"><font color="#000099">State the agreement with management regarding team progress, status
reports and briefings. The expectation should be that the teams will have a high degree of
autonomy within the scope, monetary and schedule boundaries of the project agreement.
Describe any review authority held by a bureau capital investment council or board with
respect to this project. Management has a right to be informed of team progress and
whether unusual difficulties are being encountered which jeopardize accomplishment of team
objectives. Changes in budget, mission priorities or other circumstances may necessitate
negotiation of amendments to the Project Agreement between management and the team.
Consistent with streamlining objectives, outside clearances and approvals should be
minimized or eliminated wherever possible, however to the extent that any special reviews
or clearances are required, these should be identified. </font></p>

<p class="text9"><font color="#000099"><b>VII. ESTIMATED VALUE</b></font></p>

<p class="text9"><font color="#000099">Estimate the total cost of achieving the project objective. Where
appropriate, the estimate may be stated by fiscal year, or made subject to budget
availability. The estimate might also be broken down to show total program costs,
acquisition costs, and cost of in-house personnel. However, these breakdowns may be
inappropriate where the decision as to how these costs are to be distributed may be
determined at a later point in the process. It is better to state the overall cost along
with a general description of what the cost includes, rather than to itemize costs into
categories which introduce barriers later in the process. The basis for the estimate may
be referred to as a separate document.</font></p>


<p class="text9"><font color="#000099"><b>VIII. MILESTONES</b></font></p>

<p class="text9"><font color="#000099">State the high-level project milestones. These milestones should
indicate key points in the process and key deliverables in satisfaction of overall project
objectives and performance goals.</font></p>

<p class="text9"><font color="#000099"><b>IX. TERM</b></font></p>

<p class="text9"><font color="#000099">The term of the project normally begins on the date of execution of
the project agreement and concludes when the project objectives have been achieved.</font></p>



<p class="text9"><font color="#000099"><b>X. PERFORMANCE GOALS AND MEASURES</b></font></p>

<p class="text9"><font color="#000099">Performance goals and measures for this project should be consistent
with the approach required for agency strategic and annual performance planning and the
already-established goals that support this project . That is, the team will establish
performance goals defining the level of performance to be achieved by each project
activity; express performance goals in objective, quantifiable, and measurable form;
describe the process to meet the performance goals, establish the performance indicators
to be used to measure or assess the outcomes of each project activity; provide a basis for
comparing actual results with performance goals; and describe the means to be used to
verify and validate measured values. This means, for example, that if the performance
measure is to increase revenues by 15 percent in three years, there must be a way to
gather the baseline and performance data to assess the change in revenues that confirm
that the team is meeting its objective. This should include achievement of project
milestone and cost objectives, but should also include measures based on achievement of
project objectives, such as attainment of program benefits. </b></font></p>



<p class="text9"><font color="#000099"><b>XI. INCENTIVES</b></font></p>

<p class="text9"><font color="#000099">State the overall plan for incentivizing/rewarding the team for meeting
and exceeding its objectives as defined by the project's performance goals and measures.
The overall purpose is to motivate teams to accomplish their objectives by providing
rewards for meeting/ exceeding the target performance levels. The team should consult
with its human resource staff to determine what reward options are currently available
within it's agency or as a possible team incentives pilot. An example might be, &quot;if
the program objectives are attained at 90% of the estimated cost, then the team would
receive a predetermined award amount. The team incentive should establish the methodology
for determining the amount to be shared and for establishing how that amount will be
distributed among the team members.</font></p>



<p class="text9"><font color="#000099"><b>EXECUTION</b></font></p>

<p class="text9"><font color="#000099">The project agreement should be signed by the project team leader
(and, as an alternative, by team members as well) and by agency management officials at a
level above the project team leader with key authority, responsibility or influence on the
project. </b></font></p>
